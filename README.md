## What is Headless Shopify?

Headless Shopify architecture decouples the frontend (what customers see) from the backend (Shopify's commerce engine). This allows brands to:

- **Achieve faster load times** - Custom frontends optimized for performance
- **Full design freedom** - No theme limitations
- **Omnichannel experiences** - Same backend, multiple frontends
- **Advanced personalization** - Tailored shopping experiences
- **Global scalability** - Handle high traffic with custom infrastructure

Common frontend frameworks used:
- [Shopify Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/) - Shopify's official React framework
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)
- [Remix](https://remix.run/)
