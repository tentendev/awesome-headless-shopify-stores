- ⚡ **Achieve faster load times** - Custom frontends optimized for performance
- 🎨 **Full design freedom** - No theme limitations
- 📱 **Omnichannel experiences** - Same backend, multiple frontends
- 🎯 **Advanced personalization** - Tailored shopping experiences
- 🌍 **Global scalability** - Handle high traffic with custom infrastructure
